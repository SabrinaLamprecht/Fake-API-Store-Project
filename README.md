# Fake API Store Project

This project is a React e-commerce app powered by the Fake Store API. It allows users to browse products in a list or carousel, view detailed product information, and perform CRUD operations: create new products, update existing ones, and delete products. The app uses React Router for navigation and React-Bootstrap for styling, with Axios handling all API requests.
